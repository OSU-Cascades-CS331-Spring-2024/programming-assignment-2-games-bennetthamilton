Analysis:

1. Simulate four games between yourself and the minimax player on a 4x4 board, with the
depth parameter set to 5, 3, 2, and 1, respectively.
    a. What were the results of each game?

    b. Did the minimax player’s moves change when the depth was limited to smaller
    and smaller values?

    c. What was the average time per move for each of the games? Comment on why
    there is or is not a difference.


2. Simulate two games between yourself and the minimax player on an 8x8 board, with the
depth parameter set to 5 and 2.
    a. What were the results of each game?

    b. Did the minimax player’s moves change when the depth changed?

    c. What was the average time per move for each of the games? Comment on why
